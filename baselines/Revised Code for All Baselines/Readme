The code in this folder corresponds to running all available forecasting dates for various methods.

For example, to verify the performance of different methods on the given data. For each method, we forecast for every single valid forecasting date.

Specifically, as statistical methods do not require training, we attempt to forecast all time series in parallel. To achieve this, I created SLURM jobs to run the forecasts in parallel and aggregate the results further.
We use a concrete example to demonstrate how, for a single time series with 60 timestamps, I test for all available dates. This allows us to use data during [1,t] to forecast [t+1, t+4], where t ranges from 4 to 56. Then we evaluate the performance of the model for each t.

Finally, we summarize the average performance for each method and create the comparison table in the Overleaf doc.
